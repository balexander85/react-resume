Creating my resume with React and Typescript

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

This command is used to analyze your project's source code for potential issues, styling errors, and violations of
coding standards. It runs a linter on your codebase, which is a static code analysis tool that checks your code against
a set of predefined rules.

Linting helps ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency within your project. It can identify problems such
as syntax errors, unused variables, and inconsistent formatting, making it an essential tool for maintaining a clean and
error-free codebase.

Running `npm run lint` will initiate the linting process and display a list of any issues found in your code. Linting
results can be accessed in the terminal or saved to a report file, depending on your project's configuration.

By addressing the issues highlighted during linting, you can enhance the quality of your code and reduce the likelihood
of introducing bugs and errors into your project. It's a recommended step in your development workflow to ensure a high
level of code consistency and maintainability.

After running `npm run lint`, review the reported issues, and make the necessary code adjustments to resolve them.

### `npm run lint:fix`

In addition to running the linting process, this command also attempts to automatically fix some of the detected issues.
It is especially helpful for resolving minor code style and formatting problems. Running `npm run lint:fix` can be part
of your regular code cleanup and improvement routine.

Keep in mind that while `npm run lint:fix` can automatically correct certain issues, it might not address all potential
problems. Manual review and adjustments may still be required for some issues that cannot be auto-fixed.
